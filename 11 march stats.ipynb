    "The t-test and the z-test are both statistical tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. The main difference between these tests lies in the assumptions made about the population and the available information.\n",

    "T-Test: The t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and needs to be estimated from the sample. It is appropriate for small sample sizes (typically when the sample size is less than 30) and when the population follows a normal distribution. Example Scenario: Let's say you want to compare the mean scores of two groups of students who have undergone different teaching methods (Group A and Group B). You collect a random sample of 20 students from each group and measure their scores. Since the population standard deviation is unknown, you would use a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference between the mean scores of the two groups.\n",

Example Scenario: Suppose you want to test whether the mean height of a population of adult males is significantly different from a given standard height. You collect a large sample of 200 adult males and measure their heights. Since you have a large sample and the population standard deviation is known or can be assumed, you can use a z-test to determine if the mean height significantly differs from the standard height."

    "Interpretation: Based on the sample data, we can be 90% confident that the true population mean falls within the range of approximately 63.22 to 66.78.

    "The confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the true population mean based on the sample data. It quantifies the uncertainty associated with the estimate and helps us understand the precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean."

    "To conduct a hypothesis test to determine if caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time, we need to set up the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (Ha).

    "Step 4: Determine the critical t-value: Since we have a two-tailed test at a 90% confidence level and 29 degrees of freedom (n-1), the critical t-value can be obtained from a t-distribution table or using statistical software. For a 90% confidence level and 29 degrees of freedom, the critical t-value is approximately ±1.699.\n",

    "Conclusion: Based on the results of the t-test, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at a 90% confidence level. The sample data indicates a substantial difference between the average reaction time observed and the hypothesized population mean of 0, indicating that caffeine has an impact on reaction time."
